# WaCoDiS Job Status Listener
![Java CI](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/metadata-connector/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)
  
The **WaCoDiS Job Status Listener** interacts with the WaCoDiS Job Management API in order to update the status information (e.g. running, waiting, ...) of currently registered WaCoDiS Jobs.

Climate changes and the ongoing intensification of agriculture effect in increased material inputs in watercourses and dams.
Thus, water industry associations, suppliers and municipalities face new challenges. To ensure an efficient and environmentally
friendly water supply for the future, adjustments on changing conditions are necessary. Hence, the research project WaCoDiS
aims to geo-locate and quantify material outputs from agricultural areas and to optimize models for sediment and material
inputs (nutrient contamination) into watercourses and dams. Therefore, approaches for combining heterogeneous data sources,
existing interoperable web based information systems and innovative domain oriented models will be explored.

### Architecture Overview

For a detailed overview about the WaCoDiS system architecture please visit the 
**[WaCoDiS Core Engine](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/core-engine)** repository.  

## Overview  
The **WaCoDiS Job Status Listerner** is an intermediate componenten that subscribes to message about progress of running WaCoDiS processing jobs. The Job Status Listener interacts with **[WaCoDiS Job Manager](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/job-definition-api)**. Information about a job's processing progress are received via the WaCoDiS System's message broker (RabbitMQ). Received information about processing progress are used to update the corresponding job's status by communication with Job Manager's REST API.
### Modules
The WaCoDiS Job Status Listener is a stand-alone Spring Boot application comprisiung only a single module.
### Utilized Technologies
* Java  
WaCoDiS Job Status Listener uses (as most of the WaCoDiS components) the java programming language. WaCoDiS Data Access is tested with Oracle JDK 8 and OpenJDK 8. Unless stated otherwise later Java versions can be used as well.
* Maven  
The project WaCoDiS Job Status Listener uses the build-management tool Apache [maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* Spring Boot  
WaCoDiS Job Status Listener is a standalone application built with the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework.
* Spring Cloud  
[Spring Cloud](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) is used for exploiting some ready-to-use features in order to implement
an event-driven workflow. In particular, [Spring Cloud Stream](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream) is used
for subscribing to asynchronous messages within thw WaCoDiS system.
* RabbitMQ  
For communication with other WaCoDiS components of the WaCoDiS system the message broker [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) is utilized. RabbitMQ is not part of WaCoDiS Data Access and therefore [must be deployed separately](#preconditions) if WaCoDIS Data Access is deployed as part of the whole WaCoDiS system. 
* OpenAPI  
OpenAPI is used for the specification of core WaCoDiS data model and APIs.  


## Installation / Building Information
### Build from Source
In order to build the WaCoDiS Job Status Listener from source _Java Development Kit_ (JDK) must be available. Data Access 
is tested with Oracle JDK 8 and OpenJDK 8. Unless stated otherwise later JDK versions can be used.  

Since this is a Maven project, [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) must be available for building it. Then, you
can build the project by running `mvn clean install` from root directory

### Build using Docker
The project contains a Dockerfile for building a Docker image. Simply run `docker build -t wacodis/job-status-listener:latest .`
in order to build the image. You will find some detailed information about running the Job Status Listener as Docker container
within the [run section](#using-docker) .

### Configuration
Configuration is fetched from [WaCoDiS Config Server](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/config-server). If config server is not
available, configuration values located at *src/main/resources/application.yml*.   
#### Parameters
TODO
Describe configuration parameters


### Deployment
This section describes deployment scenarios, options and preconditions.
#### Preconditions
* (without using Docker) In order to run Data Access Java Runtime Environment (JRE) (version >= 8) must be available. In order to [build Data Access from source](#installation--building-information) Java Development Kit (JDK) version >= 8) must be abailable. Data Access is tested with Oracle JDK 8 and OpenJDK 8.
* A (running) instance of [WaCoDiS Job Manager](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/job-definition-api) must be available 
* In order to receive message a running instance a running instance of [RabbitMQ message broker](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) must be available.  
* When running data access as part of the WaCoDiS system, messages are published by [WaCoDiS Core Engine](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/core-engine). For testing purposes can be used to publish/mock messages about processing progress of a WaCoDiS Job.
  
The server addresses are [configurable](#configuration).  
  
 * If [configuration](#configuration) should be fetched from Configuration Server a running instance of [WaCoDiS Config Server](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/config-server) must be available.

## User Guide
### Run Job Status Listener
Currently there are no pre-compiled binaries available for WaCoDiS Job Status Listener. Job Status Listener must be [built from source](#installation--building-information). Alternatively Docker can be used to (build and) run WaCoDiS Job Status Listener.

Job Status Listener is a Spring Boot application. Execute the compiled jar (`java -jar  job-status-listener.jar`) or run *de.wacodis.jobstatuslistener.app.JobStatusListenerApplication.java* in IDE to start the Job Status Listener.

#### Using Docker
1. Build Docker Image from [Dockerfile](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/job-status-listener/blob/master/Dockerfile) that resides in the project's root folder.
2. Run created Docker Image.

Alternatively, latest available docker image (automatically built from master branch) can be pulled from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wacodis/data-access-api). See [WaCoDiS Docker repository](https://github.com/WaCoDiS/wacodis-docker) for pre-configured Docker Compose files to run WaCoDiS system components and backend services (RabbitMQ and Elasticsearch).

## Contribution - Developer Information
This section contains information for developers.

### Branching
The master branch provides sources for stable builds. The develop branch represents the latest (maybe unstable) state of development.
